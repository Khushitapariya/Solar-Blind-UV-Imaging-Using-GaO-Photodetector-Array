# Solar-Blind-UV-Imaging-Using-GaO-Photodetector-Array

This project presents a solar-blind UV imaging system based on a Ga₂O₃ photodetector array. Due to the ultra-wide bandgap of Ga₂O₃, the detectors are sensitive to UV radiation while remaining insensitive to visible and infrared light, enabling solar-blind detection without external filters.

Objective

To study sensor-level UV image formation by analyzing photodetector array responses, including responsivity and noise characteristics, and reconstructing UV intensity patterns from raw signals.

Key Concepts

Solar-blind UV detection

Ga₂O₃ photodetector arrays

Sensor-level image formation


Applications

Flame detection, environmental monitoring, and secure UV imaging.
